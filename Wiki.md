## Tracking

Every day, you complete 3 personalized questionnaires at times you set,  
designed to help you monitor your mental health and emotional well-being.  
These questionnaires encourage you to reflect on your daily habits, track your mood, and stay mindful of your progress over time.

You can also set personal commitments and note down your thoughts to create a meaningful record of your journey.

By consistently completing these tasks and maintaining your streak, you earn coins and hatching tickets as rewards for your efforts.  
These rewards allow you to hatch eggs, collect unique companions, and watch them grow as a fun and motivating part of your self-improvement journey.  
The more consistent you are, the more you progress in both tracking your mental health and expanding your collection.

## Collection

Purchase eggs of various rarities and use hatch tickets to progress towards unlocking new companions.  
Once an egg hatches, you will receive a random companion, each with unique traits and designs.  
Keep your companions happy and well-fed to help them grow and thrive.  
With a wide range of companions to discover, the challenge awaits â€“ can you collect them all?
